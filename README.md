# Hello-World
My First Git Hub Project
This is the start of re-committing myself to the passion/hobbie/career of programming. It is both scary and fun because I know it will be challenging, and pray that I am ready for this, that programming is a great fit for me as much as I feel I am a great fit to mind and do as a software developer, not to mention that it is another tool in the box of my technology tricks for the trade. Thank you GitHub for helping me along in this journey, and I look forward to sharing this adventure with all my GitHub cohorts, whoever is interested! Now.....



LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!
